    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      So, who is this guy, you may be wondering . well to put it simply, I am a
      Fullstack JavaScript Engineer with a focus on frontend technologies and building user interfaces
      <br />
      I write my code majorly in JavaScript/TypeScript and use frameworks like react and vue extensively for creating
      complex frontend application logic.
      <br />
      My API's are written in NodeJs(Express). I also
      use MongoDB and Firebase as my databases often. I also develop my software with a test driven development approach
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not deep in thought thinking about why my code doesn't work the
      way i want it to(they work eventually at the end of the day or week...or
      month. and the satisfaction that comes when they finally work is really
      unrivaled) i usually read about start-ups
      <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">here ðŸ“ˆ</a> and watch movies
      <a href="https://netflix.com">here ðŸŽ¬</a>, and a huge fan of coldplay, even
      made a project on them <a href="https://arinze19.github.io/colddrumkit.html">here</a>. I contribute and give back to community using
      <a href="https://kwanda.co" target="_blank">Kwanda</a>.
      <br />
      I'm really passionate about building products that positively affect lives
      using software and stay up to date with the latest technology
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a question or want to collaborate on making products that affect millions of
      people positively?
